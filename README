"FiSH 10" - a blowfish encryption plug-in for mIRC 7,
  compatible to previous FiSH scripts and other clients!

This is an encryption addon for mIRC, it is based on FiSH v1.30 and is compatible to the
original 'blowcrypt/bloW' script as well as Mircryption and other clients.
It supports private chat, channel, topic encryption and comes with a secure key-exchange
system (DH1080). In addition to the regular ECB Blowfish mode, it also supports the more
secure CBC mode.

Supported mIRC versions: mIRC 7.x only!
	You can download the latest version from www.mirc.com

== INSTALLING ==

	Don't shy away, the guide below is just verbose, installing is easy!

	Setting up FiSH 10 should be pretty straightforward as patching mirc.exe is no longer
	required. If you have been using FiSH.dll before, it is however strongly recommended
	that you restore mirc.exe to its unpatched, original state before you install FiSH 10.
	You can of course apply a "crack" after that, but mIRC is a good product, so if you use
	it every day, I strongly advise you to get a legit lifetime license.

	Alright, now on to the actual installing procedure. If you have not been using FiSH.dll
	before, or if you are installing mIRC 7 from scratch, you can skip this paragraph.
		- Unload FiSH.mrc from mIRC like so: //unload -rs $shortfn($nofile($mircexe) $+ FiSH.mrc)
		(- Unload blow.mrc, blowcrypt.mrc, mircryption.mrc, etc.)
		- Delete FiSH.dll
		- Delete FiSH.mrc
		(- Delete DH.dll blowfish.dll bloW.dll)
		- Keep! blow.ini

	Now that your mIRC installation is clean, we can move on to the actual installing part.
		- Download the latest zip file from http://github.com/flakes/mirc_fish_10/downloads
			(if you haven't already)
		- Shut down mIRC!
		- Extract fish_10.dll, fish_inject.dll and fish_10.mrc to your mirc.exe folder.
			Do the same with libeay32.dll and ssleay32.dll if your download contains them.
		- If necessary, extract blow.ini-EXAMPLE and rename the file to "blow.ini".
		- You can edit fish_10.mrc if your blow.ini is at a different location than that folder.
			This is useful for people who installed mIRC into Program Files but keep their settings
			in the Users/AppData folder.
		- Start mIRC back up. If your mIRC is automatically connecting on startup, you might
			have to turn that off, or add a timer. It is extremely important that fish_10.mrc
			always loads before ANY IRC connection is made.
		- Install the script: //load -rs $shortfn($nofile($mircexe) $+ fish_10.mrc)
		- Shut down mIRC, and start it again
		- Two lines like this should show up (and no error popup):
			*** FiSH 10 *** by [c&f] *** fish_inject.dll compiled XXX XX 2010 12:00:00 ***
			*** FiSH 10 *** by [c&f] *** fish_10.dll     compiled XXX XX 2010 12:00:00 ***
		- If that is the case, FiSH 10 is now ready for action!
		- Connect to your networks and do your thing.

	If an error like "patching ... failed" shows up, something seems wrong with your setup.
	It could be something simple like an incompatible OpenSSL DLL, something weird like
	your AV scanner, or a bug in FiSH 10. If you made sure you installed the latest version,
	you can check here for existing problem reports, or create a new one:
	http://github.com/flakes/mirc_fish_10/issues
	(Hint for Vista and above: Hit Ctrl + C to copy the message box contents into the clipboard,
	then paste into your bug report using Ctrl + V)

	If you downloaded the ZIP file with the OpenSSL DLL files included, you might have to
	install this too:
	www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=A5C84275-3B97-4AB7-A40D-3802B2AF5FC2

	When mIRC updates, FiSH 10 should just continue to work in 99% of the cases, unlike
	the previous solution. And it's open source, pretty cool, he?

	You can report bugs at http://github.com/flakes/mirc_fish_10/issues
	or ask for help in the old FiSH.dll's forums: http://fish.secure.la/forum/
	Please don't message me on IRC.

	If you are an IRC enthusiast like I am, you should also check out ZNC, the best
	bouncer software available: http://en.znc.in/

	FiSH 10 does not contain any special code for decrypting psyBNC or sBNC logs.
	Why should it? ZNC's buffers play back just fine, including appended (not prepended)
	time stamps. I do consider adding support for psyBNC's network prefix thing at some
	point though, since there seems to be a bunch of people actually using that.

== Multi-network support ==

	The old FiSH never supported using different keys for #chan on NetworkOne, and #chan
	on NetworkTwo. The new FiSH does fully support this while still maintaining blow.ini
	backwards compatibility in all directions.

== CBC MODE ==

	FiSH 10 implements Mircryption's CBC mode, as defined here:
	www.donationcoder.com/Software/Mouser/mircryption/extra_cbcinfo.php

	FiSH 10 is the first add-on to deploy a fully backwards compatible DH1080 key exchange
	that AUTOMATICALLY enables the more secure CBC encryption mode if both parties use
	FiSH 10. You won't notice a difference, but your messages will be encrypted stronger
	than ever. Key exchanges with users of older versions and other scripts are completely
	unimpaired.

	There are however at least two broken DH1080 implementations that take the remainder of
	the string in DH1080_(INIT|FINISH) instead of splitting at space characters:
		- "[G]Script (OrbitIRC)" and "Trillian Astra".
	You can use the right-click menu in queries to selectively disable CBC mode key exchange
	for those users. Please note that this is only a problem if you initiate the key exchange,
	not if they do.

== ABOUT ==

	fish_10.mrc is a 1:1 copy of FiSH.mrc, with some modifications to account for proper
	Windows Vista and 7 support, to facilitate DLL loading, for CBC mode and
	multi-network awareness.

	I would like to thank RXD for the work he has put into the FiSH addon over the last
	few years. However, he has been slow with updates and unwilling to open source a
	simple mIRC addon like this, so someone had to take over!

	FiSH 10 is using "CPatch" by armagedescu, thanks. It contains some code from
	http://dirtirc.sourceforge.net/ (blowfish core) and some utility methods from
	http://code.google.com/p/infekt/ (which is an excellent NFO viewer by the way).
	The rest of the code is what I contributed myself and is licensed under the
	"Go fuck yourself, it's free!" license.

== TECHNICAL ==

	FiSH 10 makes heavy use of OpenSSL. It is recommended that you use the SSL libs
	(ssleay32.dll and libeay32.dll) that come with the download, but other recent
	libraries should work too. If they don't, FiSH 10 will let you know on startup.

	You can read some lines about the in-memory patching in fish-inject.cpp. fish_inject.dll
	(compiled from fish-inject.cpp, patcher.cpp and socket.cpp) does the magic of intercepting
	the system calls and managing buffers. For complete lines, it calls into fish_10.dll which
	does the actual IRC parsing and encryption things.
	Key-exchange, getting the "outside" IP etc. is still handled by fish_10.mrc, like it
	has always been.

== SECURITY NOTE ==

	You are advised to use TrueCrypt or a similar solution to protect your blow.ini file. While all
	the keys are stored encrypted, the encryption is not particularly strong and could be broken
	without a lot of effort!

	Furthermore, DON'T exchange keys via plaintext (IRC/email/Facebook/whatever). This defeats the
	entire purpose of encryption. Instead, use DH1080 key exchange to establish a secure connection
	for (channel) key exchange.

	And, obviously, DO NOT store any log files on unencrypted disks.

	When using DH1080, please be aware that DH1080 does NOT protect you against sophisticated man-
	in-the-middle attacks where the attacker is able to read and modify your IRC data stream in
	real time.
	You can spot an attacker like that by using the Show key right-click menu entry, and comparing
	the key contents via an absolutely man-in-the-middle-proof channel, such as via telephone or a
	meeting in person.

== KNOWN ISSUES ==

	FiSH 10 is incompatible to the following applications. Please whitelist mirc.exe in these:
		- "AdMuncher"
	This is because FiSH 10 integrates itself into mIRC similarly to these apps.

	If you continue to use your old blow.ini file, and have been using a non-ANSI-compatible crypt
	mark (such as the default middot "·"), using any right click menu from within mIRC will convert
	your blow.ini file from ANSI to UTF-8 which will effectively destroy FiSH 10's ability to
	properly read the crypt mark.
	The suggested workaround is using $chr(183) instead of "·".

== THE FUTURE ==

	- A feature that tries to avoid sending truncated fish messages and splits the message into
		several lines automatically (with an option to turn it off).
	- Add support for Micryption's DH1080_INIT_cbc and DH1080_FINISH_cbc method.
	- Make a DH1080 specs document
